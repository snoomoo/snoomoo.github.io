#Search Engine Usage
In the search bar, after the intended query, type ! followed by the respective character for whatever search engine you want to use.

Search engines implemented by default include:
<pre>
Google            !g (default search)  
Google Images     !i  
Youtube           !y  
Wikipedia         !w  
IMDB              !m  
Urban Dictionary  !u  
Nyaa.se           !n  
Tcgplayer         !t  
</pre>

For example:  
<pre>baroque period artwork !i</pre>
would search google images for baroque period artwork

#Issues
Css var tags might not work in some browsers  
In chrome, this can be fixed by editing "Experimental Web Platform Features" under chrome://flags

#To-do list
WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a pretty simple element right now, all it does is read a local .txt and paste it into a textarea. 
I currently have it set to read the savefile fom xpad but you could change it to anything by changin the source directory in the jquery section.

In the future, I will add a new document / save function and formatting tools.
